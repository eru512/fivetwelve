Approved maps can add to a player's K/D ratio and player points (in ranked matches), as they represent the competitive aspect of the Plazma Burst 2 Multiplayer. When a fair, fun, and balanced map receives enough positive reviews and becomes popular (or Eric considers the map fair for the game), Eric Gurt will approve the map. In total, there are â‰ˆ200 approved maps.","name":"Set Embed Description"},{"storage":"1","varName":"embed","channel":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Embed Message"}]}]
